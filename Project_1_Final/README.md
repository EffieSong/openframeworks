# Project 1 - Chameleon's Story
Once upon a time, there was a chameleon.One day, it lay on the apple thinking. The apple is red, so becomes red. It rested on the elephant's back. The elephant is grey, so it becomes grey.

Wherever it went, it had to keep changing colors. It felt very unhappy. It didn't know what its own color was.

So it found a leaf it liked and turned green with it. It was happy all spring and summer. It thought it had its own color.

However, by autumn, the leaves were turning yellow. It turned yellow with the leaves, and then, in winter, it fell from the tree with the leaves. It fell to the ground, being so sad that it did not know what to do.

At this time, it met another chameleon. This chameleon had the same trouble. They all had to keep changing colors. However, the other chameleon was more clever. It told it that they could always walk together, so that wherever they went, they would still turn red when they  meet apples, but not because of the apple, just because they became the color of each other.
