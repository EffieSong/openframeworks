# Project 1
## Concept
I want to tell a short story which is from a song. It is a very lovely and romantic story about how a chameleons find its own color. I was touched when I fisrt heard it. 

Here's the story:
Once upon a time, there was a chameleon. One day, it lay on the apple thinking. The apple is red, so becomes red. It rested on the elephant's back. The elephant is grey, so it becomes grey.

Wherever it goes, it has to keep changing colors. It felt very unhappy. It didn't know what its own color was.

So it found a leaf it liked and turned green with it. It was happy all spring and summer. It thought it has its own color. However, by autumn, the leaves were turning yellow. It turned yellow with the leaves, and then, in winter, it fell from the tree with the leaves. It fell to the ground, being so sad that it did not know what to do.

At this time, it met another chameleon. This chameleon had the same trouble. They all had to keep changing colors. However, the other chameleon was more clever. It told it that they could always walk together, so that wherever they went, they would still turn red when they  meet apples, but not because of the apples, just because they became the color of each other.


I think people will have different feelings about this story. For me, it reflects something in a love relationship, which is that people should be with people who are similar to them. Two people whose independent personalities are not so strong will be happy being together. But if one's personality is too strong then the other, the other one will become an accessory. I hope everyone can find the right person for themselves, and more importantly, find themselves.

At first I thought about adding some possible interaction, such as exporing the environment with mouse. But later I thought it was not necessary, so I decided to make it a simple linear story. However if you have any suggestion about adding interaction please add coments below youtube video !

## Future iterations
* Add more scene
* Improve the graphic
* Add background music
* Add narrator
* Any interactions?

## Process questions
*  Import SVG to OF and manipulate the color of the image.
*  I'm also thinking about the meaning of design motion graphic by coding rather than After Effects.

## Evaluation
I improve my structure of coding through the process. However I find it hard to implement some animation only using OF.
